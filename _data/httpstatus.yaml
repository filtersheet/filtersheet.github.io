  - code: 101
    name: Switching Protocols
    description: The 101 (Switching Protocols) status code indicates that the server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via the Upgrade header field (Section 6.7 of [RFC7230]), for a change in the application protocol being used on this connection.

  - code: 102
    name: Processing
    description: The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it.  This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.
